-   disable states for nav buttons; prev and next disable class
-   slide grouping for progress bar via attributes for slides and progress bar to connect which slide group to which progress bar
-   curcular progress bar like a donut
-   validation per slide. check validation from API. connect with TypeScript guy.
-   go to slide attribute button
-   go to slide deppending on input
-   donut bar should work even if progress bar element is not present
